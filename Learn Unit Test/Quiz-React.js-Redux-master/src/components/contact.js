        <h2 className='title2'>Short Bio</h2>

        <p>
          I was born on May 20, 1992, in Verchniodniprovsk, Ukraine. Almost
          all my relatives were teachers at that time. My father was teacher
          of arts in a kinder garden, mother and her father were teachers of
          music, two grannies were teachers of math and English.
        </p>

        <p>
          At school, I was one of the best pupils of our town and near villages.
          All years that I was studying at school I was a winner of all town
          olympiads in technical disciplines, I liked to study a lot! Also, I was an active
          pupil of the school of arts, where my mother worked. I played piano,
          sang in the choir, attended drawing and pencilling classes, acted in
          the drama theatre.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was very thin as for my age, but I had great results in many
          kinds of sports. For example, two times I was the winner of our town
          in triathlon, I broke the records on the run for 3 km and on shooting.
          I was a teammate of school's basketball team and town's volleyball
          team and we have won many competitions together. And at the end of my
          study at school, I received a valuable prize as "The Best Graduate
          of the Verchniodniprovsk".
        </p>

        <p>
          After school I entered Mechanics and Mathematics department of the best university
          in Ukraine for that moment - Taras Shevchenko National University of
          Kyiv. I was a good student and even better sportsman in university. I was
          teammate of the main volleyball team of University and captain of the
          department team. All years my team was a champion of University in
          volleyball. Also, I participated in competitions in basketball,
          powerlifting, arm wrestling and triathlons. In University I have achieved
          big muscle mass and power characteristics. I was 107 kilos and was able
          to do squats with 180 kg, deadlift with 220 kg and bench press
          with 130 kg, but I was injured once and after that, I can do only fitness.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have married at the third year of study in the University. My wife was
          my classmate. She is very talented, very smart, very beautiful. And we
          love each other very much. I think that we are the perfect couple
          because our tempers are very similar. We both are a little bit crazy,
          both love math, both like to travel and, You know, both our mothers are
          teachers of music. :) I thank my wife for all she has done for me,  I can't
          imagine my life without her.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the university, it was a time of travel. After the third
          year of study, I went to Seattle, WA, by Work and Travel program and
          worked for seafood factories in beautiful and wild Alaska. I was working
          about 16-20 hours a day, 7 days a week.
          My second great trip was to Sao Paulo, Brazil. It was a science conference
          about algebra and its applications. I should note, that without Vladimir V. Sergeichuk this trip was
          impossible at all and without Pinchuk Fund I wasn't able to pay for this
          travel. But I won financial support and I thank them for all that very much.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the fourth year of study, I got a job of Math Consultant
          in MBA Strategy. I was teaching adult people how to solve difficult
          mathematical and logical problems in the fast and easy way, using
          mathematical rules, tricks and shortcuts so they could pass GMAT and
          GRE tests and enter to the best universities in the world. But my heart has always
          belonged to the programming.
        </p>

        <p>
          But my heart has always belonged to the programming. And especially I
          wanted to develop computer games. So at the last year in the university,
          I started to study this field from all the sides: game design, programming
          and testing. And after finishing the university I got a job at Enixan
          Entertainment as a game designer of a new genre direction in the company.
          Our team successfully developed a game and deployed it on production,
          but unfortunately, just after this moment, I had to leave the
          company because of the relocation to Spain. But this game is alive,
          people still playing it and the game even had several big updates from that time.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Spain, I tried to continue my career as game designer, but very soon
          I realized, that to program, to implement functionalities and
          visualizations for me is much more interesting than to generate crazy ideas
          about who is the character, how it looks like, what is his goal and
          how to get money from the final user. So I returned to pure programming,
          algorithms and data structures. I met Alex, very good programmer and
          teacher of programming, who helped me to learn some good patterns and
          methodologies and very soon I got a job of javascript front-end
          developer in a small but very good company. Now every my day is full
          of motivation to learn something new, so even when I am coming home
          tired after a day full of work, I continue to program my own projects
          just because it is so interesting and inspiring! And this project is
          one of such projects that I have done at my free time just to learn
          something new about topics that I am working with. I hope this passion
          will never leave me during my career of a programmer.
          Because I feel like I finally found my place in the life.
