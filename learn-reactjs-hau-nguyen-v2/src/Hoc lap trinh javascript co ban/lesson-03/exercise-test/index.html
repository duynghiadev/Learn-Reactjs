    <!--Please note that the project you are working on is a legacy project which may not function correctly. In order to improve its performance, there are two key actions that need to be taken:

    1. The first action to take is to import packages in JavaScript files as the global libs are no longer available.

    2. The second action is to verify the file imports, as they may be broken. It is important to ensure that all files are properly imported to avoid any potential issues.-->
